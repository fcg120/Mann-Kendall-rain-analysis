"The Mann-Kendall test was adjusted in this Python code to develop trend analysis and display the result in a window. A spreadsheet should be created with 'Data' in one column and 'Precipitation' in the other column.

In the 'Data' column, the date should be entered in the format dd/mm/yyyy corresponding to the daily, monthly, or annual precipitation data, and in the 'Precipitação' column, the precipitation value in millimeters should be entered."
